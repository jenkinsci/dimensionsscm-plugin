<p>The above allows you to save assets that got created to changed as a result
  of the build process to your Dimensions project. You can specify one or more
  Ant include Filesets that will then be used to scan the build workspace for
  files that will saved to your Dimensions project.<br>
  <br>
  If files have not been changed or created as a result of your build, then
  they will be ignored. This saving process will <i>not</i> store any build
  dependency information in Dimensions - just the files.<br>
  <br>
  Some examples of valid patterns are shown below.<br>
  <br>
  <i>**/*.exe</i>               This will match any .exe files<br>
  <i>**/*.obj</i>                This will match any .obj files<br>
  <i>src/*.h</i>                  This will match any .h files in the src/ directory<br>
  <br>
  Inclusion patterns are used to include files, exclusions to exclude them from the upload.<br>
  <br>
